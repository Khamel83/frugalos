# ✅ MVP COMPLETE - Local-First AI Router

**Status**: ✅ All tests passing
**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Test Results**: 5/5 passed

---

## 🎯 What We Built

A **Local-First AI Routing System** that:

1. ✅ **Always tries local models first** - FREE processing with Ollama
2. ✅ **Shows upgrade costs when needed** - When local can't achieve 9/10 quality
3. ✅ **Tracks sessions** - Maintains conversation context and cost history
4. ✅ **Session-aware cost analysis** - Shows real session costs vs single task costs
5. ✅ **Database persistence** - SQLite tracking of all tasks and sessions

---

## 📊 Test Results

```
✅ PASS - Local Success (simple tasks handled locally)
✅ PASS - Upgrade Needed (complex tasks show upgrade options)
✅ PASS - Session Continuity (session state maintained across tasks)
✅ PASS - Database Persistence (tasks saved and retrievable)
✅ PASS - Cost Statistics (accurate cost tracking)

5/5 tests passed 🎉
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### CLI Interface (Interactive)

```bash
# Interactive mode
python3 -m hermes.routing.cli --interactive

# Single prompt
python3 -m hermes.routing.cli "Write a function to sort a list"

# Auto-upgrade if needed
python3 -m hermes.routing.cli "Complex task" --auto-upgrade

# Continue session
python3 -m hermes.routing.cli "Follow up question" --session SESSION_ID
```

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Start Hermes server
python3 hermes/app.py

# Process prompt
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/routing/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Hello world"}'

# Upgrade to cloud
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/routing/upgrade \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id": "...", "prompt": "...", "model": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"}'

# Check session status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/routing/session/SESSION_ID

# Get cost stats
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/routing/stats?days=7

# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/routing/health
```

## 💡 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Local-First Routing
- Tries all 4 local models: llama3.2:3b, qwen2.5-coder:7b, gemma2, llama3.1:8b
- Picks best local result based on quality scoring
- Only shows upgrade if local < 9/10 quality

### 2. Quality Scoring (MVP Heuristics)
- Response length analysis
- Code detection for programming tasks
- Structure checking (paragraphs, bullets)
- Keyword overlap with prompt
- Scores 0-10, target is 9.0

### 3. Session Management
- Tracks conversation context across multiple tasks
- Maintains session state (local or cloud tier)
- Calculates cumulative costs
- Persists to database

### 4. Session-Aware Cost Analysis
- Shows single task cost: $0.0009
- Shows full session cost: $0.18 (25 tasks)
- Calculates session premium: 200x
- Warns about context transfer costs

### 5. Database Tracking
- SQLite for zero-config persistence
- Sessions table: ID, tier, cost, task count, timestamps
- Tasks table: prompts, responses, models, costs, quality scores
- Cost statistics queries

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Local Models (from testing)
- **llama3.2:3b**: 8.7/10 quality, 1.27s avg time, best for QA/conversation
- **qwen2.5-coder:7b**: 7.9/10 quality, 4.47s avg time, best for code
- **gemma2**: 7.9/10 quality, 6.14s avg time, best for analysis
- **llama3.1:8b**: 6.6/10 quality, 14.51s avg time, backup model

### Cloud Models
