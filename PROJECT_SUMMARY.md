# FrugalOS Web Agent - Project Summary

## 🎯 **Vision in One Sentence**

Create a "free agent" that maximizes local AI processing on your M4 Mac mini (16GB RAM) while providing web-based access from anywhere, testing the limits of what's possible with open-source AI vs when remote models are necessary.

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

**Cloud Frontend** (frugalos.khamel.com) ↔ **Local Agent** (Mac mini via Tailscale)

- **Frontend**: Simple web interface for submitting requests
- **Backend**: Smart orchestrator + FrugalOS CLI integration
- **Communication**: HTTP POST through secure Tailscale network
- **Processing**: Local-first with intelligent remote fallback

---

## 🧠 **Key Innovation: Research-Based Task Decomposition**

Based on 2024 LLM research findings:

### **Select-Then-Decompose Strategy**
1. **Selection**: Classify request intent (Research/Analysis/Extraction/Creation)
2. **Decomposition**: Break into structured subtasks using proven templates
3. **Execution**: Run with verification after each step
4. **Constraints**: Apply budget/local-first rules (ACONIC framework)

### **Future Intelligence Layer**
- Hierarchical breakdown (TRUST framework)
- Reusable task patterns (LEGOMem approach)
- Dynamic adaptation (WebDART method)
- Stepwise refinement (MOSAIC technique)

---

## 📊 **What Makes This Different**

### **Local-First by Design**
- Always tries free local models first
- Only escalates to paid models when proven necessary
- Tracks learning: "what tasks fail locally?"
- Optimizes for cost-effectiveness over speed

### **Comprehensive Data Logging**
```
Input Request → Classification → Decomposition → Execution → Results
     ↓              ↓               ↓             ↓         ↓
  Store Every Step → Analyze Patterns → Learn → Optimize
```

### **"Free Agent" Philosophy**
- Fire-and-forget task submission
- Handles complex multi-step requests autonomously
- Learns from experience to improve future performance
- Transparent cost tracking and decision logging

---

## 🎯 **Core Capabilities**

### **Task Categories**
- **Research**: Information gathering, fact-finding
- **Analysis**: Break down concepts, compare options, reasoning
- **Extraction**: Process documents, extract structured data
- **Creation**: Generate content, write code, create artifacts

### **Smart Features**
- **Budget Enforcement**: Hard limits on remote spending
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates via web interface
- **Learning System**: Tracks success rates per task type/model
- **Context Management**: Handles file uploads and complex requests

## 💾 **Data Strategy: Track Everything**

### **Database Schema Highlights**
```sql
Jobs: input_request, task_category, selection_confidence,
      decomposition_strategy, constraints_applied, success_rate

Job Steps: step_type (selection/decomposition/execution/verification),
           pattern_used, verification_result, model_performance

Analytics: success/failure rates per task type, cost analysis,
           learning patterns, optimization opportunities
```

### **Learning Approach**
- **Phase 1**: Just collect comprehensive data
- **Phase 2**: Basic pattern analysis and suggestions
- **Phase 3**: Active learning and optimization

---

## 🛠️ **Technical Stack**

### **Proven, Simple Technologies**
- **Backend**: Flask (Python) + SQLite
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap + Server-Sent Events
- **Communication**: HTTP over Tailscale
- **Integration**: FrugalOS CLI wrapper
- **Deployment**: Simple, reliable setup

### **Key Design Principles**
- **Simplicity over complexity**
- **Reliability over features**
- **Data collection over AI complexity**
- **Working system over perfect system**

---

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Technical Success**
- Local execution success rate by task category
- Cost savings vs always using remote models
- System reliability and error handling
- Response time and user experience

### **Capability Discovery**
- What tasks can local models handle reliably?
- Where do local models consistently fail?
- What's the cost/benefit tradeoff for different tasks?
- How much can be accomplished with $0 budget?

### **Learning Value**
- Pattern recognition improvements over time
- Optimization suggestions from collected data
- Decision-making transparency
- Knowledge transferability to other projects

## 💭 **Project Philosophy**

> **"Build a working system first, make it intelligent later."**

This project prioritizes getting a functional local AI agent running quickly, then gradually adding intelligence based on real usage data. The comprehensive logging ensures every interaction provides value, even the early "simple" versions.

The goal isn't to rebuild ChatGPT locally—it's to discover the boundaries of what's possible with today's local AI models and build a system that maximizes those capabilities while respecting budget and privacy constraints.
