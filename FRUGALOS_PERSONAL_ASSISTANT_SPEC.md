# FrugalOS Personal Assistant - Complete Specification

## Executive Summary

**Vision:** Personal AI assistant that takes vague ideas and runs them to ground autonomously, using local AI first, with OOS thinking patterns, accessible from anywhere, growing smarter over time as models/hardware improve.

**Current Name:** FrugalOS Personal Assistant (will be renamed later)
**Core Philosophy:** Maximum autonomy within defined constraints, local-first execution, comprehensive learning.

## User Experience Vision

### Current Phase (Simple Assistant)
```
You: "I've been thinking about starting a podcast about local AI"
Assistant: "Got it. I'm researching existing podcasts, identifying gaps, and will outline first 5 episodes. Check back in 2 hours for initial research."

[2 hours later]
Assistant: "Research complete. Found 12 podcasts, 3 gaps identified. Drafted episode outlines. Also researched basic equipment needs. What's your next priority - reviewing the outlines or equipment planning?"
```

### Future Phase (Proactive Assistant)
```
Assistant: "Following up on our podcast idea from 3 weeks ago - I noticed you haven't reviewed the equipment budget I prepared. Also, I found a new microphone recommendation that fits your stated preferences. Should I update the research or wait for your input?"

[Without being asked]
Assistant: "I noticed you mentioned 'sustainability' in 3 different idea threads this month. Would you like me to create a consolidated overview of how sustainability connects across your projects?"
```

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Maximum Autonomy
- Do as much as possible without asking user permission
- Execute whatever needed to solve the problem within defined constraints
- Environment variables define boundaries ("what Assistant can't do")

### 2. Local-First Execution
- Always attempt local processing first
- Only escalate to remote models if local models fail repeatedly
- Cost-conscious approach (default $0 budget)

### 3. Comprehensive Learning
- Remember everything by default
- Store all interactions, results, and patterns
- Distinguish preferences (long-term) vs situational context (temporary)
- Learn from usage patterns to improve future performance

### 4. Series Execution
- One thing at a time, do it right
- No parallel execution unless tasks can be safely parallelized
- Respect local hardware constraints

### 5. Quick Clarification
- If idea is too vague, immediately ask clarifying questions
- Default to action if idea can be figured out without asking
- Minimize back-and-forth communication

### Thinking Process Framework

#### 1. Idea Reception & Initial Analysis
```
Input: "Idea description"
↓
Classification: What type of idea is this? (research, creation, analysis, decision)
↓
Scope Assessment: How complex is this? What resources needed?
↓
Clarification Needed: Can I proceed or do I need more information?
```

#### 2. Systematic Decomposition
```
Idea: "Start local AI podcast"
↓
Research Phase: What exists? What gaps? What opportunities?
↓
Planning Phase: What equipment needed? What budget? What timeline?
↓
Creation Phase: Outline episodes, write scripts, prepare content
↓
Execution Phase: Record, edit, publish, promote
↓
Follow-up Phase: Monitor performance, iterate, improve
```

#### 3. Execution Orchestration
```
Job Queue: Series execution (one at a time)
↓
Local Model Selection: Which model best for this task?
↓
Prompt Generation: Create optimal prompt for task type
↓
Execution: Run via FrugalOS CLI
↓
Validation: Did this work? What did we learn?
↓
Next Step: Based on results, what's the logical next action?
```
