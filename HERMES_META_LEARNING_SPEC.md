# Hermes Meta-Learning System Specification

## Executive Summary

**Core Insight:** Our own design process revealed that asking the right questions upfront would have reduced our 10-step iterative process to 2-3 steps. Hermes must learn from its own interactions to front-load critical questions and optimize future conversations.

**Meta-Learning Philosophy:** "Ask the right questions now, based on what we've learned from helping you before."

## Front-Loaded Question System

### Core Question Categories

#### 1. **Intent Clarification Questions**
```
"What type of outcome are you looking for?"
Options:
• Research & Information Gathering
• Analysis & Decision Making
• Creation & Generation
• Planning & Organization
• Problem Solving

"Is this a one-time exploration or ongoing project?"
```

#### 2. **Constraint Definition Questions**
```
"What are your resource constraints?"
• Budget: $___ (or "use local/free only")
• Time: Immediate / This Week / Exploratory
• Tools: Any restrictions or preferences?
• Privacy: Should this stay completely local?

"Are there any approaches you want to avoid?"
```

#### 3. **Success Criteria Questions**
```
"What would make this exploration successful for you?"
• Specific deliverable needed?
• Decision to be made?
• Understanding to be gained?
• Action to be taken?

"How will you validate or use the results?"
```

#### 4. **Context & Preference Questions**
```
"Is this related to previous ideas we've discussed?"
• Yes: Continue thread #___
• No: Start fresh exploration
• Sort of: Build on previous patterns

"Based on our history, I think you prefer [X]. Still accurate?"
```

#### 5. **Scope & Depth Questions**
```
"Should I focus on:"
• Big picture overview
• Detailed comprehensive analysis
• Immediate next steps only
• Full exploration with alternatives

"How thorough should I be vs. how quickly do you need results?"
```

### Adaptive Question Selection

#### Question Priority Algorithm
```python
def select_front_loaded_questions(user_input, user_history):
    """Select optimal questions based on input and history"""

    base_questions = [
        intent_clarification,
        constraint_definition,
        success_criteria
    ]

    # Add context questions if related history exists
    if related_threads := find_related_conversations(user_input, user_history):
        base_questions.append(context_continuation)

    # Add preference questions if patterns detected
    if pattern := detect_user_preference_pattern(user_history):
        base_questions.append(preference_confirmation)

    # Add scope questions for complex ideas
    if complexity_score(user_input) > THRESHOLD:
        base_questions.append(scope_clarification)

    return prioritize_questions(base_questions, user_history)
```

#### Learning When to Ask Questions
```python
def should_ask_question(question_type, user_input, history):
    """Learn optimal timing for different question types"""

    effectiveness_score = calculate_question_effectiveness(
        question_type,
        similar_past_inputs,
        resulting_process_efficiency
    )

    # Only ask if historical data shows it improves outcomes
    return effectiveness_score > MINIMUM_BENEFIT_THRESHOLD
```

---

## Process Pattern Recognition

### Learning from Completed Threads

#### Efficiency Metrics
```sql
CREATE TABLE process_efficiency (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    thread_id INTEGER,
    total_questions_asked INTEGER,
    total_execution_time_minutes REAL,
    user_satisfaction_rating INTEGER,
    process_efficiency_score REAL,
    optimization_opportunities TEXT,
    lessons_learned TEXT,
    created_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Pattern Categories
```python
PATTERNS = {
    "vision_clarification": {
        "description": "Understanding ultimate goal saves 50%+ time",
        "trigger_words": ["build", "create", "system", "platform"],
        "success_rate": 0.85,
        "time_saved_average": 0.6  # 60% time reduction
    },

    "constraint_definition": {
        "description": "Early constraint discussion prevents rework",
        "trigger_words": ["budget", "cost", "local", "remote"],
        "success_rate": 0.92,
        "rework_prevented": 0.75
    },

    "success_criteria": {
        "description": "Clear success criteria improves satisfaction",
        "trigger_words": ["need", "want", "goal", "outcome"],
        "success_rate": 0.78,
        "satisfaction_improvement": 0.65
    },

    "context_continuation": {
        "description": "Building on previous work accelerates progress",
        "trigger_patterns": ["related to", "similar to", "follow up on"],
        "success_rate": 0.89,
        "time_acceleration": 0.4
    }
}
```

### Optimization Opportunity Detection

#### Process Analysis Algorithm
```python
def analyze_process_efficiency(completed_thread):
    """Identify opportunities that would have shortened the process"""

    opportunities = []

    # Check if early vision clarification would have helped
    if has_vision_ambiguity(completed_thread):
        opportunities.append({
            "type": "vision_clarification",
            "estimated_time_saved": calculate_vision_clarification_savings(),
            "confidence": 0.8
        })

    # Check if constraint discussion was late
    if had_constraint_rework(completed_thread):
        opportunities.append({
            "type": "constraint_definition",
            "estimated_rework_prevented": calculate_constraint_savings(),
            "confidence": 0.9
        })

    # Check if success criteria were unclear
    if had_unclear_outcomes(completed_thread):
        opportunities.append({
            "type": "success_criteria",
            "estimated_satisfaction_improvement": calculate_success_criteria_savings(),
            "confidence": 0.7
        })

    return opportunities
```

    def generate_conversation_start(self, user_input):
        """Generate optimal opening questions based on learned patterns"""

        # Classify the input type and complexity
        intent = classify_intent(user_input)
        complexity = assess_complexity(user_input)

        # Check for related historical patterns
        similar_patterns = find_similar_conversations(user_input)

        # Generate personalized question sequence
        questions = self.select_questions(intent, complexity, similar_patterns)

        return self.format_questions(questions, user_input)

    def adapt_question_sequence(self, user_response, conversation_state):
        """Adapt follow-up questions based on user responses"""

        # Analyze user response patterns
        response_type = classify_response(user_response)

        # Update understanding of user preferences
        self.update_user_preferences(user_response)

        # Generate next question or proceed to execution
        if self.has_sufficient_clarity(conversation_state):
            return self.generate_execution_plan()
        else:
            return self.generate_follow_up_question(conversation_state)
```

### Personalization Engine

#### User Preference Learning
```python
class UserPreferenceLearner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.communication_style = {}
        self.depth_preference = {}
        self.question_tolerance = {}
        self.decision_style = {}

    def learn_from_interaction(self, interaction_data):
        """Learn user preferences from each interaction"""

        # Track communication style preferences
        self.track_communication_patterns(interaction_data)

        # Track desired depth of analysis
        self.track_depth_preferences(interaction_data)

        # Track question tolerance and preferences
        self.track_question_engagement(interaction_data)

        # Track decision-making patterns
        self.track_decision_patterns(interaction_data)

    def personalize_questions(self, base_questions, user_context):
        """Adapt questions to user's learned preferences"""

        personalized_questions = []

        for question in base_questions:
            # Adapt question wording to communication style
            adapted_question = self.adapt_question_style(question)

            # Adjust question depth based on preferences
            adapted_question = self.adjust_question_depth(adapted_question)

            # Only include if user tolerance allows
            if self.should_ask_question(adapted_question, user_context):
                personalized_questions.append(adapted_question)

        return personalized_questions
```

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def handle_initial_submission():
    user_input = request.form['idea']
    session_id = create_session()

    # Generate front-loaded questions based on learning
    conversation_starter = meta_learning_engine.generate_conversation_start(user_input)

    # Store initial state for learning
    store_interaction_state(session_id, {
        'initial_input': user_input,
        'questions_asked': conversation_starter['questions'],
        'predicted_outcome': conversation_starter['predicted_process']
    })

    initial_clarity = assess_clarity_level(idea_data)

    # Execute the idea
    results = execute_idea_thread(idea_data)

    # Record process completion
    process_end = datetime.now()
    final_clarity = assess_clarity_level(results)

    # Analyze process efficiency
    efficiency_analysis = meta_learning_engine.analyze_process_efficiency({
        'initial_input': session_data['initial_input'],
        'questions_asked': session_data['questions_asked'],
        'execution_time': (process_end - process_start).total_seconds(),

    """Continuously analyze patterns to improve question selection"""

    while True:
        # Analyze recent completed threads
        recent_threads = get_recent_completed_threads(days=7)

        for thread in recent_threads:
            # Extract optimization opportunities
            opportunities = analyze_process_efficiency(thread)

            # Update question effectiveness metrics
            update_question_effectiveness(opportunities)

            # Identify new patterns
            new_patterns = detect_emerging_patterns(thread)

            # Update conversation templates
            if new_patterns:
                update_conversation_templates(new_patterns)

        # Sleep and repeat

    user_comment = request.form.get('question_feedback', '')

    # Update question effectiveness immediately
    update_question_metrics(question_id, user_rating, user_comment)

    # Adapt current conversation if needed
    if user_rating < 3:
        return generate_alternative_approach(session_id)
```

#### Long-term Pattern Analysis
```python
def analyze_long_term_patterns():
    """Weekly analysis of overall pattern effectiveness"""

    # Compare process efficiency before and after meta-learning
    before_metrics = get_metrics_before_meta_learning()
    after_metrics = get_current_metrics()

    improvements = calculate_improvements(before_metrics, after_metrics)

    # Generate insights for system evolution
    insights = generate_system_insights(improvements)

    # Update system configuration based on learnings
    update_system_configuration(insights)
```
