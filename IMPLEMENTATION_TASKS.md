### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Database**: SQLite with sqlite-utils for simplicity
2. **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events for progress updates
3. **Process Management**: subprocess with asyncio for FrugalOS calls
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and retry logic
5. **Security**: Simple token-based auth between components

### Dependencies to Add
```
flask>=2.3.0
requests>=2.31.0
sqlite-utils>=3.36
asyncio (built-in)
watchdog>=3.0.0  # For file monitoring
```
